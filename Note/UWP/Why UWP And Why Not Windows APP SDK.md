# UWP is abandoned by Microsoft, why still UWP?
UWP is a new kind of program started from Windows 10. It was designed to run on "Universal Windows Platform".
UWP Apps have limited authorities. Behaviors such as reaching all files can be limited by users. However, the fail of Windows Phone directedly resulted to the deserting of UWP. Now Microsoft is trying to develop Windows APP SDK.

**However, I have these reasons to consider using UWP in a higher priority.**

## Natural limited accessory to sensitive informations could get more trust from users.
**Windows APP SDK can easily do things some company like: scan all your files in your disks, and the App is just for Instant Messaging.** Using UWP, natural limited authorities could let users trust you more.

## More friendly to your disks.
