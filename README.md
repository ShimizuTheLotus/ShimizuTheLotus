Want to know more about TagFind?

TagFind is a re-make after my draft Tagme_. The repo is temporarily private. Wait till I finish it up.


### Announcement
I only update source code on GitHub, if you see my code on other sites, that's not what uploaded myself and I have no accounts on those websites. If you want to know whether the account is mine, feel free to ask me after you haven't found any info useful here.
